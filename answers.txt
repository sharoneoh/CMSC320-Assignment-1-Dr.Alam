Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: One may consider using git because it is a reliable and industry
standard tool. In addition, when working in groups, git is a lot more useful
to use because multiple people are able to access the same code in a faster, 
and less tedious to share one machine. When working on a project, git also 
makes it easier to be able to access the version history. In which, we are
able to see what changes were made and if necessary, revert to those 
past versions. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it
 might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to relatively any field, from the
business to medical field. Some examples include: trading, to be able to 
capitalize on gains and minimize losses, in the medical field to keep track 
of patient studies and trials, and every research field because research 
uses data. Data science helps as it can work with repetitive scenarios,
capitalize gains, improve the algorithm, and working to minimize dangerous 
scenarios. Overall, the results can be applied to the next tests or can help a 
company push out a beneficial product. As well, in Formula 1, I have seen teams
utilize data science to improve the design of the car, making sure that the 
aerodynamics and lap times improve as the year progresses.
